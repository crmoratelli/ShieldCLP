# ShieldCLP

  The following project refers to one of the steps in the development of an Open Source PLC with a web interface using Raspberry Pi.
The hardware was developed with the aim of integrating 8 of the microcontroller GPIO's as digital inputs-outputs for the PLC platform, leaving the other ports at the user's disposal.

The shield will allow connection to an N4DBA06 module to support analog inputs and outputs.

The RPI and the N4DBA06 module will be powered through the shield.

The power supply used must have a voltage output of 12Vdc.
